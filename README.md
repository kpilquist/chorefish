ChoreFish App
Chorfish Was a project that I and a local pediatrician used to monitor chores and screen time. 
We had a house with 5 boys, so we wanted to come up with a fair way of doing chores.
The app was designed using an early version of reactNative and laravel 7; which also synchronized across phones. 
A Demerit system was institutionalized; in our house if one threw a temper tantrum, a countdown from 3 was started, then screen time was deducted by 5 minutes. 
Generally more defiance was greeted with more screen time loss; it's happened a time or two. 
Often chores could be done to make up for the lost screen time, and the intention that chores could also be assigned and sent to a childs' device along with feedback should the chore not have been done to standards. 
This helped keep the peace in our home, maybe this can serve as a template should anyone else need a similar tool.
